## Security & Risk Warnings (Read Before Use)

This plugin integrates with OpenClaw AI automation capabilities and carries inherent risks such as model hallucinations, unpredictable execution, and prompt injection. After you authorize DingTalk permissions, OpenClaw will act under your user identity within the authorized scope, which may lead to high-risk consequences such as leakage of sensitive data or unauthorized operations. Please use with caution.

To reduce these risks, the plugin enables default security protections at multiple layers. However, these risks still exist. **We strongly recommend that you do not proactively modify any default security settings**; once relevant restrictions are relaxed, the risks will increase significantly, and you will bear the consequences.

We recommend using the DingTalk bot connected to OpenClaw as a **personal conversational assistant**. Avoid deploying it directly in enterprise production environments. If you plan to use it with a company account, please comply with your company's information security policies.

> By using this plugin, you are deemed to have fully understood and voluntarily assumed all related risks and responsibilities.

## Requirements & Installation

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **OpenClaw**: Installed and running properly. Visit the [OpenClaw website](https://openclaw.ai/) for details.
- **Version**: OpenClaw ≥ **2026.4.9**. Check with `openclaw -v`.

> If below this version, upgrade with: `npm install -g openclaw`

### One-Click Install + QR Auth (Recommended)

```bash
npx -y @dingtalk-real-ai/dingtalk-connector install
```

During installation, the terminal will display a DingTalk authorization QR code. Scan it with the **DingTalk mobile app** and tap "Create Bot" to complete authorization.

When you see `Success! Bot configured.`, the authorization is complete. Then restart the Gateway:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

> 💡 **Scan failure does not affect installation**: Even if the QR flow fails, plugin dependencies will still be installed. See [Manual Setup Guide](docs/DINGTALK_MANUAL_SETUP.md) to complete configuration.
